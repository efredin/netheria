## Notes
* Using beta verion of yup for validation to make typescript usage less painful
* Did not spend any time on responsive design'
* In there interest of time, I did not implement any error handling.
* Used quite a few inline component styles where further encapsulation or global themes may have been more appropriate.

## TODO:
* Validation error summary

## Known issues
* Invalid autocomplete option where the default is not valid, but I didn't want to prepend a blank value.
* Side nav is not anchored when screen scrolls.
